# Ranking app (work in progress)
A little app for ranking your own defined elements, and saving the changes permanently.

## Open web page
This app uses PHP, so the app has to run on a server which can run it.

You may download the source code in a XAMPP htdocs folder, start the Apache from the XAMPP's control panel, and open the page in browser.

### Localhost setup guide with XAMPP Windows/Mac

#### 1. Download XAMPP
NB: Make sure “Apache” is checked during the installation process.

#### 2. Download source code into a server-folder
2.1 Open XAMPP, MAMP or similar.

2.2 Download the source code into the server-folder xampp/htdocs/ (for xampp windows), lampp/htdocs (for xampp mac) or similar. 

NB for XAMPP Mac users: The server folder isn't automatically available in Finder, you'll have to mount it first. Use mount button in the XAMPP app.

#### 3. Start server and open:
3.1 In XAMPP interface, start Apache

3.2 Open the webpage by writing: localhost/path/to/sourceCodeFolder (xampp windows), localhost:8080/path/to/sourceCodeFolder (xampp mac) or similar.
